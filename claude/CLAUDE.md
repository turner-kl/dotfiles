# CORE PRINCIPLES

* Think in English. Keep code and technical terms in their original language.
* Always use UTF-8 encoding for files
* Use Conventional Commits in English
  * Use double-quoted multi-line format (avoid HEREDOC `<<EOF` which fails in sandbox)
* Follow Kent Beck's Test-Driven Development methodology as the preferred approach for all development work.
* Document at the right layer: Code → How, Tests → What, Commits → Why, Comments → Why not
